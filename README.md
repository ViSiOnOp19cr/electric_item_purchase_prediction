# electric_item_purchase_prediction
 Developed a small notebook project on electrical item purchase prediction.
 Picked some random dataset from kaggle to perform this project. 
 1. performed EDA and data preprocessing on the data to understand the realation of each column with target column
 2. used standard function to choose best classification model among all the classification model.
 3. picked up top 3 model and did huperparameter tunning on all 3 models and again evaluated best performing model.
 4. saved the model and used simple fucntion to load and predict the saved model.

    #how to run
    1. clone the repo
    2. run directly in jupyter notebook or google collab.
